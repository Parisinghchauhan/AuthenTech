Python: 
Main programming language.

JSON:
For loading label data.

OpenCV (cv2):
For image processing.

Keras:
High-level neural networks API integrated with TensorFlow.

**Objectives**

Accuracy: High accuracy in distinguishing counterfeit items.

Robustness: Generalize well to unseen data.

Efficiency: Quick image processing for real-time applications.

Impact: Provide a reliable tool against counterfeiting.

**Prerequisites**

Install TensorFlow: pip install tensorflow
